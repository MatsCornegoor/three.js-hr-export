  "description": "This is a minimal high resolution image export script that is easy to implement in a existing three.js sketch. Instead of rendering the high resolution image directly in the browser, this script exports a set of tiles that can be stitched together in a program like photoshop or using a simple python script. This approach has no limits in export size.",
